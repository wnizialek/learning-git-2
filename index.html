          <h1>Wilkinson - Afterglow</h1>
          <p>
Even though the dance is done,<br>
don't worry cause the night is young.<br>
Who cares where we'll go?<br>
We're ready for the afterglow.<br>
Someone hold the sun right back,<br>
            cause we want this night to last.</p>
          <p>Smoke and lasers, love and ravers,<br>
afterglow, we're ready for the afterglow.<br>
Lights and action, strong attraction,<br>
               afterglow, we're ready for the afterglow.</p>
           <p>Afterglow, we're ready for the afterglow.<br>
            Afterglow, we're ready for the afterglow.<br>
            We're ready for the afterglow.<br>
            We're ready for the afterglow.</p>
